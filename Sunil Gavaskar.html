    <h1>Sunil Gavaskar</h1>
    <p>
        Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja recalled the first time he met former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar in a recent interview. Gavaskar, who was part of India’s 1983 World Cup-winning team, was regarded as one of the legends of cricket, especially with the records he was shattering in the longest format of the game. Raja recalled how Imran Khan told the Pakistan dressing room that Gavaskarw as the best batsman.

        “When I first came across Sunil Gavaskar and he was like a God in the early ‘80s. And if Imran told you that he is the best batsman or somebody was the best batsman in the world, you looked at him, and I was in awe of what I saw, you know, even though Sunil Gavaskar was on his way out. I am talking about 86-87 series,” Ramiz Raja told Sportskeeda in a Facebook Live interview.
